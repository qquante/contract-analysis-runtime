## S-20260621-001 - Repository bootstrap

Goal:

- Create a clean repository for contract-first campaign runtime.

What was done:

- Created `C:\Users\PC\Desktop\vassago-contract-runtime`.
- Added initial docs and directory layout.
- Defined the core decision: contract-first, repo-mode secondary.
- Defined SC01 as the first Design.

Decisions:

- Do not throw away original Vassago.
- Do not copy all old tools into this repo.
- Build a deep Design Runtime first.
- Keep Foundry as a local runtime phase, not an ad hoc manual exception.

Reasoning:

- The old Vassago has many working pieces but too much top-level tool surface.
- DLT Auditor is operationally better because it has designs, phases, manifests,
  isolation and resume.
- This repo should copy that execution discipline, not its exact domain.

Blockers:

- No implementation yet.
- No real adapters yet.
- No CLI yet.

Next:

- Implement PT-023.T01-T03.
